## Acknowledgment

The benchmarks are very much inspired by
[Niklas Heers speed comparison of languages](https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison)
and [advent of code in rust](https://github.com/maneatingape/advent-of-code-rust).
Using [Earthly](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) to set up enviorments for benchmarking
as part of CI. Benchmarking each day using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

[HyperNeutrinos YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino) has been
a great resource for understanding the more comlex problems.
